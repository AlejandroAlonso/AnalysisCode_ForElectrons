This is a simple rootcore bases analysis code to read release 21.2 xAOD derivations produced with extended Calorimeter Cell information to use in ML projects.

There are 2 versions, a very simple one which reads all electron container and dump the information to root ntuple and another more sophisticated that applies a tag and probe selection for signal and a dump for background.
